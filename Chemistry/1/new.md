<p><strong>Understanding the Concepts</strong></p>
<p>Before we start crunching numbers, here are the key ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lamp Power:</strong> The lamp&#39;s power (100 W) tells us how much energy it emits as light per second. Since we are assuming 100% efficiency, this is also equal to the amount of electrical energy it uses per second.</li>
<li><strong>Photon Energy:</strong> Light is composed of individual energy packets called photons. The energy of a single photon depends on its frequency (or wavelength).</li>
<li><strong>Energy, Wavelength, and Frequency:</strong> We&#39;ll be using the fundamental relationships that connect these properties of light.</li>
<li><strong>Total Energy and Photon Count:</strong> The total energy emitted by the lamp is the sum of the energy of all the individual photons that are emitted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1: Total Energy Emitted</strong></p>
<p>The lamp has a power of 100 Watts (W). Power is the energy used or emitted per second. Since the lamp operates for 1 second, the total energy emitted is:</p>
<p>$E_{total} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time}$
$E_{total} = 100 \, \text{W} \times 1.0 \, \text{s}$
$E_{total} = 100 \, \text{J}$</p>
<p>So, the lamp emits 100 Joules of energy as light.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Energy of a Single Photon</strong></p>
<p>The energy of a single photon ($E_{photon}$) is related to its frequency (ν) by Planck&#39;s equation:</p>
<p>$E_{photon} = h \nu$</p>
<p>Where <em>h</em> is Planck&#39;s constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}$).</p>
<p>We&#39;re given the wavelength (λ) of the yellow light (560 nm), so we can find the frequency using:</p>
<p>$c = \lambda \nu$</p>
<p>Where <em>c</em> is the speed of light ($3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$).</p>
<p>First, convert the wavelength to meters:</p>
<p>$\lambda = 560 \, \text{nm} = 560 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}$</p>
<p>Now, calculate the frequency:</p>
<p>$\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{560 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}}$
$\nu \approx 5.357 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz}$</p>
<p>Now, we calculate the energy of one photon:</p>
<p>$E_{photon} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}) \times (5.357 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz})$
$E_{photon} \approx 3.549 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can directly use the wavelength in the equation for energy:</p>
<p>$E_{photon} = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{560 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}}$</p>
<p>$E_{photon} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J m}}{560 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}}$
$E_{photon} \approx 3.5496 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Calculate the Number of Photons</strong></p>
<p>The total energy emitted is the sum of the energies of all individual photons. If <em>N</em> is the number of photons:</p>
<p>$E_{total} = N \times E_{photon}$</p>
<p>We can solve for <em>N</em>:</p>
<p>$N = \frac{E_{total}}{E</em>{photon}} = \frac{100 \, \text{J}}{3.5496 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}}$
$N \approx 2.817 \times 10^{20}$</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, the number of photons emitted by the 100 W yellow lamp in 1.0 s is approximately $\boxed{2.82 \times 10^{20}}$.</p>
